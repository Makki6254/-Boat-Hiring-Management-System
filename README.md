This C++ program implements a Boat Hiring Management System where users can hire boats for specified durations between 10:00 and 16:00. Each boat has associated costs for half-hour and one-hour hires. The system maintains a fleet of 10 boats, and users can hire a boat, check end-of-day reports, and exit the system. The end-of-day report includes the total money earned, total hours hired, number of unused boats, and the most used boat.
